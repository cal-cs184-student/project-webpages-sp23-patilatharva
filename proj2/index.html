<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we explored topics on geometric modeling by building 
    Bezier curves and surfaces using de Casteljau algorithm, manipulating 
    triangle meshes represented by half-edge data structure, and implementing
    loop subdivision. It was initially challenging to understand mesh data
    structures and algorithms, but they feel very intuitive after working on this
    project!
</p>
<br>


<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

<p>
    Given a set of control points and a value t between 0 and 1, Casteljau's algorithm computes the Bezier curve by
    recursively performing linear interpolations of neighboring points, using t as the weight for the linear interpolation.
    The recursion stops when there is only 1 point left at the end of the interpolations. Doing this on different t values
    gives us different position along the Bezier curve. Therefore, evaluating the control points over all t in the range between
    0 and 1 gives the complete Bezier curve.
</p>

    <p>
        The way we implemented the Casteljau's algorithm is that at each level, we take each pair neighboring points and compute
        the linear interpolation using the equation (1 - t) * p1 + t * p2, where p1 and p2 are position vectors of the neighboring points,
        and t is the value between 0 and 1. After finishing the current level, we store all the computed value in an array, and
        we use this array as the input to the next level's computation. We repeat this process until there is only 1 point left.
    </p>
<br>


<p>
    Here is a rendering of a Bezier curve with 6 control points. The points are:
    (0.300, 0.250)   (0.100, 0.600)   (0.500, 0.750)   (0.800, 0.450) (0.800, 0.750)   (0.900, 0.450)

    By toggling the original control points around and modifying the parameter \(t\) via mouse scrolling, we generated
    a slightly different Bezier curve shown below:

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<p>
    The Casteljau algorithm for computing Bezier surface involve three seperate functions.
    \(BezierPatch::evaluateStep\), which does the exact same thing as part 1, i.e calculating new points at level \(i\) given the set of control points at level \(i - 1\) and a parameter \(t\).
    We then use \(BezierPatch::evaluateStep\) to implement \(BezierPatch::evaluate1D\), which computes the very last level of the Bezier evaluation, given the original set of control points and a parameter \(t\).
    Lastly, we use \(BezierPatch::evaluate1D\) to implement \(BezierPatch::evaluate\), which first calculates the Bezier curve of points along one axis, and then use the first axis's result to compute the Bezier surface that joins
    together the second axis.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    Given a vertex, we traverse over all the neighboring faces, getting each
    face's normal vector using the <i>face->normal()</i> method. When visiting 
    each face, we walk around its halfedges and record the location vectors of
    its three vertices. We use these vectors to calculate two edge vectors of 
    the face, then finally its area by calculating the halved norm of the cross
    product of the two edge vectors. Then, we weight the initially derived face
    normal by the face area as a fraction of the total area of neighboring faces,
    and return this normal.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We first store every relevant halfedge, vertex and face in variables for
    ease of use and clarity. We then assign faces and vertices to their correct
    halfedges (since the faces also get flipped). Finally, we go over each
    halfedge in the two triangles involved in the edge split, and reassign 
    (whenever necessary) their next halfedge, vertex and face. At the end, we
    return the initally given edge iterable.

<p>
    We drew a detailed diagram of the two triangles and how we expect assingments
    to change, so when our first implementation didn't work we just cross-checked
    our code with our diagram and found errors. Thanks to our diagram, this part
    wasn't so bad to debug.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We began with storing each relevant halfedge and vertex in variables for ease
    of use. Then, we created all the necessary new elements: 1 vertex, 2 faces,
    6 halfedges and 3 edges. We then assigned faces, edges and vertices their updated 
    associated halfedges. At this point, we marked the <i>isNew</i> flag
    as true in the newly created edges and calculated then new vertex's position
    as the midpoint between the vertices on opposite ends of the given edge.
    Finally, we went through each relevant halfedge and updated their next halfedge,
    face and vertex as needed. The <i>setNeighbors()</i> was very useful here.

    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    It helped to manually check for values in the GUI and comparing them with
    expected values - for us, this felt a lot more intuitive than using a
    debugger or print statements.
</p>
<br>

<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We started off our loop subdivision by first calculating the new vertex positions for each old and new vertex,
    following the two equations given in the lecture slides -- one equation for the old vertices, the other equation for the
    soon-to-be-generated new vertices. Basically the two equations assign different weights to the surrounding vertices of the current vertex,
    and then use the weights to calculate a weighted sum of the positions of the surrounding vertices, and assign the weighted sum as the new position of the vertices.
    The actual calculation was done by iterating through all non-boundry edges and non-boundry vertices and store the new positions of the old vertices in Vertex.newposition, and the new position of the new vertices in Edge.newposition.
    These variables will be used at the last step when we make official updates of the vertex positions.
</p>
    <p>
        Next, we subdivide each triangle in the mesh into four by connecting edge midpoints. This was done by first generating enw
        vertices and edges that split all the non-boundry edges into halves, and then flip all the new edges that connects and old and a
        new vertex. Since we have already implemented the edge split and edge flip algorithm, we utilized the two functions by first iterating through
        all old the edges and call the edge split function, and then we iterate through both the old and the new edges to call the edge flip function.
        The way we iterate through only the old edges is by taking advantage of the fact that all the edges are stored in an array, and new edges are appended
        at the end of the array. Therefore, we kept track of the size of the array before any new edges were added to the array, and we stop the iteration when
        it points to stuff beyond this size. Another thing is that since edgeSplit returns the new vertex generated during edgeSplit, we need
        to assigh the newPosition of this vertex to be edge.newPosition, where edge is the edge that we just splited. We also kept track of a variable called
        isNew, which is a boolean that is assigned to true for all the newly generated vertices and all the edges that connects to new vertices at both ends. We only want to
        flip edges that has isNew set to true.
    </p>
    <p>
        After doing edge flip and edge split, we now have a complete set of new edges and vertices with appropriate newPosition variables updated.
        As the last step, we update the position of all the vertices to the new positions. And as the very final step, we labeled the isNew variable of
        all the vertices and edges to false.
    </p>

        Notice how the sharp edges and corners became a lot smoother.
    </p>

<p>
  We loaded dae/cube.dae and performed several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. We noticed that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions.
    Here we demonstrate a potential way to pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically.
</p>
<p>
    When we split each face into 4, the division becomes a lot more even. However, along with the smoothness, there were also dents on
    the surface. This could be due to extraordinary vertices that cannot be eliminated.
